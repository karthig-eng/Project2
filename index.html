  Babu was born on 9 August 1975 in Madras (now Chennai), Tamil Nadu, India.[12] He is the fourth of the five children of Telugu actor Krishna and Indira, after Ghattamaneni Ramesh Babu, Padmavathi and Manjula Swaroop and before Priyadarshini.</p>

<p>Babu collaborated with Puri Jagannadh in 2006 for the film Pokiri, which was jointly produced by Jagannadh and Manjula.[38] Made on a budget of ₹100 million and shot within six months,[39] Pokiri became the highest grossing Telugu film of all time by the end of its run, and was screened at the 7th IIFA Awards held in Dubai.[40] Babu received praise for his performance, with Y. Sunita Chowdary of The Hindu opining that "Mahesh's understated performance in Pokiri allows him effortlessly to reclaim the title of a star, overshadowing more questionable recent career choices".[38]</p>
<p>n 2011, Babu collaborated with Srinu Vaitla for the film Dookudu, which was inspired in part by the 2003 German tragicomedy film Good Bye, Lenin!.[50] Co-starring Samantha Ruth Prabhu, the film received positive reviews upon release and became one of the highest-grossing films of the year.
